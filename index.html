            <p>You’ve been scrolling through the internet trying to figure out how to deal with what’s going on. Something is off but you can’t quite figure out what to do about it. You are tired of dealing with flashbacks, messed up relationships, zoning out at work, and feeling like at any moment someone is going to figure out that you are a mess. You have a lot on your plate to manage: family, school, your relationship, a business, and you feel like there are too many balls in the air to juggle. You have this deep dread that you are going to drop one.</p>

            <p>Your sex life may be non-existent or hanging on by a thread. Your relationship(s) are not what they use to be. You feel disconnected both emotionally and physically from everyone.</p>

            <p>You want help, you want direction, and you want a plan. You want to get life in order. How do you get going with this? Take that step and book a free initial 30-minute consultation.</p>

I’m based in Capitol Hill, Seattle, but can offer teletherapy services for all of Washington state. Click here for more information about who I work the best with and how I help.</p>

            <p>You may have been to therapy before or maybe you haven’t. Either way you want to know a little bit about the person sitting in front of you before you see them. There are just some things that’ll make you instantly rule someone out and you don’t want to waste your time with calling around. You are nervous to make the appointment or tired of trying to find a good fit. Not every therapist is a good fit for every person. It’s important to find someone who is a good fit for you. That’s why you are here.</p>
            <p>My name is Laura Wood. I am a licensed mental health counselor (LH61048244) in Seattle and am a certified EMDR therapist. I am also trained in doing sex therapy and working on completing my certification. I have been working in the mental health field for 10 years in various settings such as adoption, foster care, community mental health and hospital settings working in several states, finally landing in Washington.</p>
            <p>Though I practice in person in Seattle I also offer online counseling sessions to be able to serve all of Washington. I help people through a combination of EMDR and sex therapy. EMDR can provide relief from trauma, discomfort and shame while sex therapy can help to build a roadmap to your ideal personal and relational sexual health. Through this combination, I see happier and healthier relationships, more self esteem, increased self confidence, lowered anxiety, and a greater sense of overall well being.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about my work. I am a third culture kid having grown up abroad and moved to the US when I started university. I consider myself a goofball and love to find the funny. I can talk about food, languages, and culture all day long. If you are ok with someone who swears, will help you while making you laugh at me, and hold you accountable when needed then schedule your free consultation now.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p>Why did I come here? Why is this taking so long? This is what you think as you walk away from your weekly meeting with your therapist. You know weekly appointments help and that change is happening but...it's...so...slow. You do not have the time to wait months or years for things to improve. You thought that once you took the jump and got started then it would be different. It took so much just to start therapy and now you feel you just don’t have the time to get as deep as you need to.</p>
        <p>You deserve to have the time and space to go where you need to go. To look at the things that have been put away, tucked into a corner and on your to do list for a long time. With an EMDR intensive you have the time and space to unpack that corner and decide what to keep, what to toss, and what needs attention here and now.</p>
        <p>Weekly therapy sessions make a difference for you but you want something that fits your needs and your time frame. You can do an EMDR intensive as an adjunct therapy to weekly/biweekly sessions or an intensive on it’s own. When you come in for an intensive there is no one else scheduled. You have the therapist, office, and day(s) all to focus on yourself with no rush and no pressure to get it all done in 50-55 minutes.</p>
        <p>Doing an intensive EMDR session can be financially advantageous. Even compared to other trauma therapy doing an intensive format can decrease time in therapy and cost as you are not spending time a) checking in when arriving to the session, b) addressing day to day concerns, c) working extensively on skills that you may or may not need after therapy, and d) the wrap up as you head home. With those things out of the way you can hunker down and get through what you want or need to to go back into the world feeling rejuvenated and restored.</p>
        <p>An EMDR intensive includes:</p>
        <ul class="list-group align-items-start align-items-md-center my-3">
            <li class="list-group-item border-0" style="max-width: 500px">A free 30 minute video telehealth consultation</li>
            <li class="list-group-item border-0" style="max-width: 500px">A 90 minute initial intake</li>
            <li class="list-group-item border-0" style="max-width: 500px">A plan and goals that fit your needs and your time</li>
            <li class="list-group-item border-0" style="max-width: 500px">Coordinated follow up care with your existing therapist</li>
            <li class="list-group-item border-0" style="max-width: 500px">After doing an intensive EMDR session you will feel relief and have a sense of being able to return to more regular day to day living. I use metrics to help you see the improvement in your thoughts and symptoms so that it isn’t just me telling you that things have shifted or changed.</li>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p>It’s not your fault. That's what people tell you, but that’s not how you feel at all. The nightmares, the flashbacks, the memories, the broken relationships and the distrust in people tell you differently. Even now the thoughts about the sexual assault won’t stop.</p>
        <p>You need relief. You need someone who understands that it’s just as much about what happened as what didn't. You need relief. Just a moment to breathe. One moment without the memory. One night where the nightmares don’t startle you awake.</p>
        <p>You want to enjoy sex and feel comfortable, not only with your body but your desires as well.Sex is supposed to be fun, connecting, and relaxing. But what if, for you, your body never let you be free and now your body shuts down, overreacts, or freaks out. You want to enjoy sex and feel comfortable not only with your body but your desires as well.</p>
        <p>When you’ve been abused, hurt, or assaulted, your body stores that experience and that can make enjoying sex with a partner difficult, haphazard, or feel completely impossible.</p>
        <p>I help people who are facing sexual struggles due to past trauma and pain. Using EMDR combined with sex therapy, my clients begin to reduce flashbacks, discover more ease in their sexual expression and needs, and feel a greater sense of confidence in themselves and in their relationships.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p>You’re tired of the same ‘ol same ‘ol. You know there must be more to sex. More desire, more intimacy, more fun, and a little more...intensity.  There’s something enticing about what could happen when power and control come into play behind closed doors.</p>

        <p>You are craving more but you don’t even know how to admit your desires out loud. You’re nervous or afraid to get into kink or BDSM because you think your partner will think something is “wrong” with you.</p>

        <p>No matter how you identify, sex therapy can help bring more fulfillment to your sexual expression. There is so much percieved taboo and shame about sex, let alone when you have a part of you that wants more intensity.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to be in a partnership to benefit from sex therapy. Whether you want to know yourself better, have been through sexual trauma, or just want a place to process the shame or guilt you feel around your desires, sex therapy can help.</p>

        <p>That’s where I come in. I help people explore, connect with, and express their inner desires within their relationships. Through kink-friendly sex therapy I help people explore their sexual desires for themselves or in their partnerships. Through this I have seen people develop more trust, more intimacy, and more connection with themselves and their partners.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p>You’ve been in pain a long time. You have tried talk therapy before and it helped but it didn’t make the pain subside. You keep thinking you are tired of therapy but you can’t seem to move forward even with as hard as you are trying. You are so tired of trying.</p>

        <p>You want to stop thinking about what happened to you. People keep telling you that you should be over it by now and that’s just not true for you. Whether it was a car accident, a horrific experience at the doctor, an adoption or birth that didn’t go as expected, an assault, experiences from being a first responder, abuse or neglect, or you are dealing with a phobia, the pain from that can be reduced.</p>

        <p>You see your relationships are being affected. Every one of them from the ones at work, the ones with your friends all the way to your intimate relationship(s). Even your relationship you have with yourself is suffering. When you look in the mirror you often wonder who that person is. You can’t connect to your body and when you do you feel an overwhelming sense of panic and the need to run away as fast as you can.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to live like this anymore. The pain doesn’t have to stop you from moving forward.</p>

        <p>That’s where I come in. I help people by using EMDR to work on what has been stalling your path forward. Through the use of EMDR I see people reduce flashbacks, have better emotional regulation, have better interactions in their relationships, and gain an increased sense of self esteem and self confidence. You can choose to do EMDR online or in person.</p>

<div id="bipolar" class="container-fluid nav-section">
    <h4 class="info-section">Bipolar Disorder</h4>
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p>You wake up and before your foot even hits the floor you wonder if today will be one of THOSE days. A day where everything is too big to handle. You get out of bed and stare at the pills that are on the counter and think to yourself, “Are these even helping?” You worry that one day the meds will stop working and that you will have to start all over again. You know you need them but you are just so tired of the side effects and the ever present exhaustion that the meds bring on.</p>
        <p>Bipolar disorder is complicated. Getting a plan in place doesn’t have to be. Having someone who knows how to take your struggle and turn it into your superpower is attainable. Yes, you have a disease but that doesn't mean you can’t figure out how to work with it instead of fighting against it every day.</p>
        <p>That’s where I come in. Through working with your doctor, gathering data, and finding patterns to your moods I can help you become more confident in how to manage your symptoms. I help you plan for the times when it feels like you just can’t take any more of the roller coaster ride you are on. I have both professional and personal experience working with people who have bipolar disorder.</p>
        <p>Together we can create a plan that will show you how to have better mood management, more confidence in yourself, and be able to identify when and how to use your coping skills more effectively.</p>
        <p>Stop wondering if this is as good as it gets. You don't’ have to continue to cycle between shame and regret around your illness and how it affects you. You could continue to go back and forth until you are exhausted, but you don’t have to. Reach out and schedule your free 30 minute consultation and see how I can help you get to where every day doesn’t feel like a constant struggle.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p>Serving as a first responder is unique in many ways. Whether you work from a squad car, fire truck, ambulance, hospital, or back at the station, you make life-altering decisions every day. Your decisions could change not only your life but others as well. Now, more than ever, the pressure is on for you to do your job by the book and it can be a strain on your life.</p>
        <p>What happens when you go home at night and the day is over? You know there will always be more to do. Thoughts of another call or another emergency create a never-ending chain of stressful thoughts and sleepless nights. Are you able to separate work and home? When you first start out it is exciting work and you get to help people, which makes you proud and happy to serve. Then you start to notice changes. Often, your friends or family notice before you do. Sometimes they are the ones who tell you that you’ve changed, or that you seem a little off. It’s the smaller things that you too start to notice. You’re irritable, you're quick to anger, or you can never seem to relax, so you distance yourself from the people who are important to you. Recurring dreams of past incidents come to mind at the worst moments. You can’t pinpoint why or when this started, but now all you want is to make it stop.</p>
        <p>That’s where I come in. You will work with someone who understands the uniqueness of serving as a first responder, someone you don’t have to explain everything to or edit yourself with. You can talk to someone who has the professional experience to help you figure out a plan to get back to tackling anything that comes your way, whether on the job or at home. Don’t keep bottling this up, hoping it gets better on its own. Know that it’s okay to reach out for professional support.</p>
